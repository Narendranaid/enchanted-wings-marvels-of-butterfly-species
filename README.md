# enchanted-wings-marvels-of-butterfly-species

This project focuses on creating a robust butterfly image classification model using transfer learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset comprising diverse butterfly species, including 75 classes with a total of 6499 images, the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. Transfer learning utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accelerate model training by extracting relevant features from butterfly images. This method enhances classification accuracy while reducing computational resources and training time, ensuring efficient and effective species identification.
